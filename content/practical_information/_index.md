<!-- # Travel information -->

## Location

The workshop will take place at the [Linguistics Department of the
University of Vienna](https://linguistik.univie.ac.at/). The address is
**Sensengasse 3A, 1090 Wien** ([Google
Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/sVYUGhQYsALLbnrTA)).

We will be in **Seminarraum 3**, which is located on the **1st floor**
of the building (in the European sense, i.e. you need to go one level
up).

**Note on accessibility**: The 1st floor is accessible via an elevator.
However, to get to the elevator from the main entrance of the building
you'll need to descend a few stairs. If this is an issue for you, the
building has a back door which is wheelchair accessible and right next
to the elevator, and which can be reached through the backyard. The
backyard can be entered on the right-hand side of the building. If you
face any problems entering the building through this back door, please
contact us at +43 681 817 88 311.

## Note on booking accommodation

The 9th district, where the workshop will take place, is slightly to the
northwest of the historic center. If you haven\'t booked accommodation
yet, we recommend looking for a place that is in or close to the **9th
district (Alsergrund)** or **8th district (Josefstadt)** or **near the
U6 metro line**.

Vienna is a popular tourist destination, so while finding accommodation
via [booking.com](https://booking.com) or similar platforms should be
easy, we recommend that you book your accommodation as early as
possible.

## Transport within Vienna

Generally speaking, the best way to get around in Vienna is by public
transport. You can find the English-language website of the **Vienna
public transport authority** at <https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en>.

#### Getting to the department by tram

-   The Linguistics Department is well connected to the tram network. If
    you\'re staying in or near the historic center, this is probably the
    best option.
-   The relevant stops are
    [Spitalgasse](https://goo.gl/maps/SjdLsp4NKjDpKJsE8) (lines 37, 38,
    40, 41, 42) and
    [Lazarettgasse](https://goo.gl/maps/ED658WZkHRjYVMaP8) (lines 5 and
    33).
-   From either of these stops it takes less than 5 minutes to walk to
    Sensengasse 3A.

#### Getting to the department by metro (U-Bahn)

-   The closest metro stop is [Währinger Straße ---
    Volksoper](https://goo.gl/maps/5P7mcCgwaxVWgGPL9) (line **U6**).
-   From there, it\'s a 10-15 minute walk to the department ([Google
    Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/UCNkuX7j6WX3ptbR9)).
-   Alternatively, you can take the tram line 42 from Währinger Straße
    --- Volksoper to
    [Spitalgasse](https://goo.gl/maps/SjdLsp4NKjDpKJsE8) (1 stop) and
    walk from there (5 minutes).
-   In theory, the department is also close to the metro stop
    [Schottentor](https://goo.gl/maps/rrQY7L5q2VoEABX36) (line **U2**)
    in the historic center. However, a major part of the U2 line is
    currently closed due to construction work, so that Schottentor can
    only be reached via a replacement tram service.
-   From Schottentor, you can reach the department by taking the tram
    (line 37, 38, 40, 41 or 42) to
    [Spitalgasse](https://goo.gl/maps/SjdLsp4NKjDpKJsE8) and walking
    from there.

#### Getting there from the central station (Wien Hauptbahnhof)

If you are traveling by rail, you\'ll very likely arrive at [Wien
Hauptbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/eVM8mXZW2Sv7AGFp6) (Vienna central
station). From there, the historic center can easily be reached on the
metro line **U1**.

However, the least error-prone way to get to the **Linguistics
Department** from the main station is to **avoid the historic center**
and do the following:

-   Take a **local train (S-Bahn)** to **Wien Meidling** from platform 1
    or 2 at Wien Hauptbahnhof.
-   At Wien Meidling, change to the **U6** metro line and go to
    **Währinger Straße---Volksoper**.
-   From there, it\'s a 10-15 minute walk to the department ([Google
    Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/UCNkuX7j6WX3ptbR9)).
-   In case your train enters Vienna from the west, it will probably be
    possible to get off directly at Wien Meidling and avoid the central
    station.

#### Getting there from the airport

Vienna Airport is quite far away from the actual city, so schedule some
time to get to the city center.

-   The most budget-friendly way to get to the city center is by
    **train**, either to [Wien
    Hauptbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/eVM8mXZW2Sv7AGFp6) or to [Wien
    Mitte](https://goo.gl/maps/tcPb6jaQKoytqarXA). For train schedules,
    see the ÖBB (Austrian Railways) website at
    <https://www.oebb.at/en/>.
-   If you are traveling via **Wien Hauptbahnhof**, see above for
    directions to/from the Linguistics Department.
-   If you are traveling via **Wien Mitte**, the simplest (although not
    always fastest) way to get to the Department is to take the **U3**
    metro line to **Westbahnhof** and then the **U6** metro line to
    **Währinger Straße---Volksoper** and
    [walk](https://goo.gl/maps/UCNkuX7j6WX3ptbR9) from there.
-   If you\'re going to the department or the surrounding neighborhood
    directly from the airport, it might make sense to search for the
    destination **Wien Währinger Straße-Volksoper** on
    <https://www.oebb.at/en/> and let the system recommend a faster
    route.
-   Besides the regular ÖBB services, there is a non-stop train from the
    airport to Wien Mitte called the CAT (City-Airport Train). While
    this service is sometimes faster, we do not recommend it, as you
    will be charged €12 or more while the regular train fare is less
    than €5.

## Further travel information

Until recently Austria was a largely cash-based society, and it is still
the case that not all businesses in Vienna accept payment by card for
small amounts, so it\'s probably a good idea to bring some cash.
